# WebHookJS

WebHookJS is a CD (Continous Deployment) service I wrote because 
Netlify does'nt support deployment to self-hosted servers.

It uses Github Webhooks as a trigger to clone a repository  
The advantage is there is not much to set up, I will add a convenient  
frontend to change the setting as I progress in the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) course
